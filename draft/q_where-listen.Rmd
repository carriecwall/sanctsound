_Ever tried to explain to a friend how noisy it was in a new restaurant? Or how silent it was during a hike in the wilderness? You often find yourself making comparisons to other places you’ve been in order to make your point: it was much louder than the library but quieter than the coffee shop down the street. But how do we ensure that these comparisons are based on accurate information about what the acoustic, or listening, conditions are really like in these different places?_

The goal of the SanctSound project is to understand how noise varies in the ocean by collecting the same information about underwater sound in many places along the coasts of the United States. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Navy, who co-manage the project, selected 30 locations within seven National Marine Sanctuaries and one Marine National Monument to listen to the ocean ([map](./sanctuaries.html)).

At each of these locations, we recorded underwater sound using an underwater microphone (also known as a hydrophone) placed near the seafloor. Periodically we retrieved them to download the recordings and refresh the batteries. At shallower locations, this equipment was placed and retrieved by divers. At deeper locations, gear was deployed over the side of boats and allowed to sink to the sea floor. For these locations, a release system was placed between the hydrophone equipment and anchors and when gear needed to be retrieved, this system was triggered by a specific acoustic signal to let go of the anchorage. Buoyed by a float, the hydrophone would then rise to the surface and get picked up by scientists on a research vessel.

Our goal was to collect sound information over 3 years at each site. However, it didn’t always go smoothly: sharks ate floats, anchors got stuck in the mud, hurricanes blew gear off locations, electronics flooded, and batteries failed. Charts on this website, such as the example below for all five listening stations in Channel Islands sanctuary, show when hydrophones were deployed and the duration and quality of recordings for each listening station. These listening duration charts, found under the “Where did we listen?” tab for each sanctuary, also allow you to see when interruptions occurred and consider how these interruptions affected the sound information that you can explore in this portal.
 
 ![The SanctSound project used hydrophones to record the soundscape of seven National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS) and one National Monument (NM). Black bars indicate when good quality data were recorded at one or more listening stations at a site. Due to technical or logistical issues, there were some gaps in recordings (no shading) or periods when lower quality data was recorded (shaded box).](./images/recording_duration_allsites_mockup_tutorial.png)
 
_Ever notice when listening to the radio or a podcast that you can tell the difference between someone who was interviewed over the phone and someone who was interviewed in a professional recording studio? Recording systems vary in their performance, and what we call “high quality” versus “low quality” audio is made up of differences in how sensitive these systems are to specific frequencies (low tones versus high tones) among many other factors._

We used the same recording equipment at all of our underwater recording stations. Although data collected by different systems can be adjusted to allow results to be compared, we minimized the need for adjustments by using systems with similar performance. The measurements that you will discover through this portal have all been calibrated, which means that they have been adjusted to account for any differences in performance between the recorders. This approach allows us to compare across recording locations, and to know that the differences and similarities we see reflect the conditions of the acoustic environment.

We programmed all the recording systems to collect information over the same range of frequencies or pitches - from 20 Hertz (low pitch) to 24,000 Hertz (high pitch). For reference, people hear sounds in air that range from 20 to 20,000 Hertz. The hearing systems of marine animals, however, are tuned to hear specific sounds transmitted through water.
