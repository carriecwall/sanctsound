_Ever tried to explain to a friend how noisy it was in a new restaurant? Or how silent it was during a hike in the wilderness? You often find yourself making comparisons to other places you’ve been in order to make your point: it was much louder than the library but quieter than the coffee shop down the street. But how do we ensure that these comparisons are based on accurate information about what the acoustic, or listening, conditions are really like in these different places?_

The goal of this project is to understand how noise varies in the ocean by collecting the same information about underwater sound in many places along the coasts of the United States. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Navy, who co-manage the project, selected 30 locations within seven National Marine Sanctuaries and one Marine National Monument to listen to the ocean (map). Three sanctuaries are off the U.S. east coast, three off the U.S. west coast, and two are within the Hawaiian archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.

At each of these locations, hydrophones (underwater microphones) were placed near the seafloor and periodically retrieved so that data could be downloaded and batteries could be refreshed, then replaced. These cycles continued over 2 to 3 years. At shallower locations, this equipment was placed and retrieved by divers. At deeper locations, gear was deployed over the side of boats and allowed to sink to the sea floor. For these locations, a release system was placed between the hydrophone equipment and anchors and when gear needed to be retrieved, this system were triggered by a specific acoustic signal to let go of the anchorage. Buoyed by a float, the hydrophone would then rise to the surface and get picked up by scientists.

Our goal was to collect sound information over 2 to 3 years for each site. However, it didn’t always go smoothly: sharks ate floats, anchors got stuck in the mud, hurricanes blew gear off locations, electronics flooded, and batteries failed. Charts on this website, such as the example below for all five listening stations in Channel Islands sanctuary, show when hydrophones were deployed and the duration and quality of recordings for each listening station. These charts also allow you to see when interruptions occurred and explore how these interruptions affected the sound information that you can explore in this portal.

_Ever notice when listening to the radio or a podcast that you can tell the difference between someone who was interviewed over the phone and someone who was interviewed in a professional recording studio? Recording systems vary in their performance, and what we call “high quality” versus “low quality” audio is made up of differences in how sensitive these systems are to specific frequencies (low tones versus high tones) among many other factors._

We used the same recording equipment at all of our underwater recording stations. Although data collected by different systems can be adjusted to allow results to be compared, we minimized the need for adjustments by using systems with similar performance. The measurements that you will discover through this portal have all been calibrated, which means that they have been adjusted to account for any differences in the performance of the recorders. This approach allows us to compare across recording locations, and to know that the differences and similarities we see reflect the conditions of the acoustic environment.

We programmed all the recording systems to collect information over the same range of frequencies (tones) - from 20 Hertz to 24,000 kiloHertz. For reference, people hear sounds in air that are 20 Hertz to 20,000 kiloHertz. The hearing systems of marine animals, however, are tuned to hear specific sounds transmitted through water [link to DOSITS].
